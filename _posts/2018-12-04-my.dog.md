I always wonder why there are so many people who like to raise dogs?

Whenever I see someone walking the dog, even wearing a colorful dress, and dressing up the flowers, especially when walking through the crowded downtown area, I can’t help thinking: Many people’s feelings for dogs far outweigh those for people. The feelings are not even considered public safety at all.

### My dog ​​diary

- I love dogs, so I also love to raise dogs. No matter how good or bad the dog is, I don't care about it, as long as it can bring me the fun of raising a dog.

- Dogs are very close to people, and it takes a long time. They can almost understand what you say.

- I hope that humans can be better for animals, and the earth is the home of all animals.
